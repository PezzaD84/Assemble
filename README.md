# Assemble

Assemble is a script I've created to help provision devices using [swiftDialog](https://github.com/bartreardon/swiftDialog)

The script was inspired by the [DEPNotify starter script](https://github.com/jamf/DEPNotify-Starter) and Dan Snelsons [Setup-Your-Mac script](https://github.com/dan-snelson/dialog-scripts/tree/main/Setup%20Your%20Mac).

I wanted to help give end users a nice gui view of what is going on and also try to keep things as simple as possible. The DEPNotify script is good but doesnt give you the nice list of apps being installed. SwiftDialog can give you this list of applications and settings which gi ves the user a nice view of whats going on.

The script also gives you the ability to add a company logo and banner image to give your script a nice polished professional appearance.
