# Assemble

Assemble is a script I've created to help provision devices using [swiftDialog](https://github.com/bartreardon/swiftDialog)

The script was inspired by the [DEPNotify starter script](https://github.com/jamf/DEPNotify-Starter) and Dan Snelsons [Setup-Your-Mac script](https://github.com/dan-snelson/dialog-scripts/tree/main/Setup%20Your%20Mac).

I wanted to help give end users a nice gui view of what is going on and also try to keep things as simple as possible. In the world of zero touch it's nice to limit end user interaction and this script requires nothing from the end user.

The only part that needs customising is the policy array. This area needs to be customised to match your custom triggers in JAMF and also set to what you want to install.

It can be further customised with your company logo and a banner image to give your script a nice polished professional appearance.
